            I'm a Web Developer, Software Engineer, and Brazilian Jiujitsu competitor that brings my competitive mindset and initiative towards growth into everything I do. 
            I love solving logic puzzles whether it's working to figure out why data is returning unexpected results, how we can develop new features by implementing 
            the most effective tools from the endless innovative libraries,  or in Brazilian Jiujitsu competition deciding the best course of action at a breakneck pace 
            given the logical steps my opponent can take to advance their position.

        I've went on to work in both <a>startups</a> as a React-Native developer as well as <a>Fortune 500 companies</a> as a Software Engineer. Working in these different 
        environments gave me several perspectives on how different people work and how to collaborate on different teams so that we’re able to develop each other’s skills 
        so that we can continue to grow and make better applications.
